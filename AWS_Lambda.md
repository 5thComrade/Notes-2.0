# AWS Lambda

### Serverless Framework

Serverless Framework aims to ease the pain of creating, deploying, managing and debugging Lambda functions.
It integrates well with CI/CD tools.
It has CloudFormation support so your entire stack can be deployed using this framework.

### Install the serverless framework

Open CloudShell on AWS Console. Run the following command in CloudShell

```sh
sudo npm install -g serverless
```

If you want to check if serverless framework was installed correctly, run the following command in the terminal

```sh
serverless
```

The best part of using AWS CloudShell is you don't need to configure AWS Credentials, the framework will pick the credentials from the user that is logged in.
