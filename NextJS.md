### **What is NextJS?**

NextJS is a React framework for building web applications. It uses React for building user interfaces and also provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications. These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundeling, compiling and more.

### **React Server Components (RSC)**

React Server Components is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version 18 which was quickly embraced by NextJS.

The architecture introduces a new way of creating React components, spliting them into 2 ways

- Server components
- Client components

In NextJS, all components are Server components by default. They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database. However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions.

To create Client components, its necessary to add 'use client' at the top of the component file. Client components do not have the ability to read files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.
