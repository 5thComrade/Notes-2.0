## Building large scale web apps

### Internationalization

As the internet continues to connect people all over the world, it becomes 
increasingly important to design and develop web applications that cater 
to users from various regions and locales. This process is known 
as internationalization, and it ensures that our applications are 
accessible, functional, and culturally appropriate for users all over the 
world.

Good internationalization practices lead to:

- An increased user base: By adapting our applications for 
different regions and locales, we can reach a larger global 
audience, increasing our user base and potential customer base.

- An enhanced user experience: By allowing users to access our 
applications in their preferred language and cultural context, we 
can provide a more personalized and engaging experience.

- Compliance with regulations: In some countries, there are legal 
requirements for applications to be accessible in the local 
language.
