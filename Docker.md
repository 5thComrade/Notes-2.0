### What is docker?

Docker helps developers build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere â€” without tedious environment configuration or management.

### Why docker?

- Better isolation in a single OS
- reduced environment variances
- increase speed of change

Docker Desktop is the standard way of using and learning Docker on any machine except for servers. On server's you do not install Docker Desktop but instead use Docker Engine.

Docker Desktop includes the docker engine, cli, compose, BuildKit, Kubernetes, scan, sbom and more.

### 3 major ways to run containers

- locally (Docker Desktop)
